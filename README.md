# pandas-challenge

This repository contains my submission for the pandas Challenge of my UT-Austin Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

This challenges consists of an analysis of school performance of an example school district by different schools, grades, school size, and school spending. Performance is evaluated based on average math and reading scores as well as percentage passing each subject and overall. 

Based on this analysis, there are several notable trends in school performance. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is a drop in average scores, as well as passing percentages, that is associated with a decrease in per pupil spending. Additionally, larger schools have a much lower percentage of their student body passing math. Finally, Charter schools have much higher percentage of their student body passing math than Disctrict schools. It seems likely that all of these factors-larger size, lower spending, and less prestige-are all correlated and are each having some affect on school performance, especially in terms of math scores, but it is unclear from this analysis which factor is most significant.
